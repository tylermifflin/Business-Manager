## Description
The purpose of this app is to connect a database in mysql to the server.js using inquirer for the user to be able to view and edit the database in an easy to use manner without knowing how to use mysql or how to code in general, this app would be great for an HR employee that needs the data about the company but doesn't know how to code. The user will be given a list of the following options once the app is started: View All Departments, View All Roles, View All Employees, Add Department, Add Role, Add Employee, Update Employee Role and Exit. The user will be shown the data in a table format and will be able to add and update data. I learned a lot about how to connect mysql to the server.js using inquirer, how to connect multiple tables together, insert new data, and update existing data in mysql. I learned about the console.table dependency in order to get rid of the default index column that is shown using console.table without it. 

Here is a link to a video showing the functionality of the app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/126EEly9iEp5M21AmzezXRk_9-7Mdmv1d/view?usp=share_link 

Here is a screenshot of the app:
